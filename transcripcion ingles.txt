In this video I am going to teach you how to use artificial intelligence to help you create an ecommerce business 
0:05 
from scratch that generates income because the economic opportunity for entrepreneurs is not so much in what 
0:10 
this powerful technology offers but rather in what you do with it so let's get down to business I'm going to put on the glasses that I'm wearing 
0:17 
many days of work with my eyes tired we're going to go to work So I'm going to open chat 4 which is the paid one to 
Search for winning product 
0:23 
less as of today and I will introduce it in the next Chrome you are an expert ecommerce marketer give me five ideas of 
0:29
products that are lightweight solve a problem that people have in their day to day be eye-catching and ideal to make a dropshipping store with them 
0:36 
we are going to use the dropshipping business model only to find a product validate what works and and 
0:43 
then in any case we would scale the store to a private label importing that product and making a distribution 
0:48 
from where you are or from external warehouses to speed up delivery times and the user experience 
0:54 
but dropshipping and I always say it to this day it is still very very useful to be able to validate 
1:00
products that work whether or not they have traction and people are interested in buying it and I put it there you don't need to describe them 
1:07 
just indicate the name of the product So we're going to give you enter 
1:14 
well collapsible water bottle solar portable charger Ultra Thin zipper 
1:20 
repair this I don't know about it cooling pad for mobile devices organizer of 
1:25 
magnetic cables I'm going to this third one because it's the only one I haven't seen 
1:33 
I'm going to underline it ok I'm going to open aliexpress 
1 :39 
I am going to paste the address and we are going to look for what products appear to us, look here in this suggestion kit of 
1:46
zipper repair it seems that it is a sought-after product, look here there are several products 
1:52 
we have this and this I go for the best sellers I select this and 
1:58 
look at it is a product that looks consistent with a packaging this is always something which I like because it doesn't 
2:04 
it seems like a product from China that comes with seedy plastic bags if there isn't that packaging let me 
2:11 
see the shipments are worth 0.78 to Spain and arrive on June 9 
2:17 
or it is about 12 days there is another payment option Here is a video 
2:25 
ok Apparently it is a kind of universal zipper that can repair you 
2:31
broken zippers worth redundancy this can be quite useful it is light and above all the price is something that I like 
2:37 
that is 0.78 I send you more 2.09 leaves us a very good margin and above all to be able 
2:44 
to give to the product a perception of value that makes sense in the head of 
2:49 
people buy it if there is a product that, for example, when you see it in a store is like I would not pay more than 50 
2:55 
euros for it and they are selling it to you 100 you will never buy it if you are a product that your perceived value is 
3:01 
higher than what they are asking for. That is where a sensation of offer is generated and where you see a good deal to buy it 
3:08
Therefore, this is a product that, so to speak, allows us to raise its price and, at least in my opinion, the perceived value of 
3:15 
in the user is going to be maintained, leaving us our profit margin. Next, we are going to ask charge 
Naming of the brand 
3:21 
to find us a brand name for this product, it's a product that I think we can try to sell and 
3:27 
for this I've given it, it generates 8 brand name ideas for an online store that sells a repair kit of Universal zippers The name must be 
3:34 
short easy to pronounce and with a hook let's get to it 
3:40 
difix Pro zipper Master repair zip zipit United Solution quick zip save 
3:48
zippers all without preparation Ok now what we have to do is 
3:55 
start some of them look like these that are short and easy to pronounce and search if they are available 
4:03 
The One Daddy domain I am going to paste the first domain I am going to look for it 
4:09 
ok zipfix Pro dot com is available divided motion bands And look it's not easy to find 
short word names 
4:15 that have rhythm and are available let's try the other one that I liked also ok This 
4:22 
it is not available only the dot is for Spain I am interested in having the dotcom that is more international So I think the 
4:28
The decision is clear I'm going to go back and go to the other zifics Pro domain the others haven't finished convincing now 
Shopify account setup 
4:35 
what we're going to do is create a zipfix Pro email that's going to be the one we're going to use for create an online store 
4:40 
we are going to use the shopify link that I leave in the description because we have a promotion to open our store for one euro a month 
4:46 
we simply enter our email fix fix Pro at gmail.com which we have created 
4:53 
free trial and we start here it makes us a small survey well we can answer it 
4:59 
or simply skip skip everything come on ahead Where is it 
5:05
located the Spain business here you are going to see me configuring the store so give me a second to 
5:12 
configure it 
5:21 
good Now we must select a plan from our shopify store we have 
5:26 
three options the difference between the plans is basically the commission that you are going to be paying of what you are going to take 
5:31 
when processing the payment with external payment processors, notice that the intermediate is only called 1% and 
5:38 
the first plan, the most basic, 2% this it compensates when you already have a volume and I go to the basic one for now 
5:46 
and it is advisable to pay the annual version because you save 108 euros in 
5:52
comparison of making a monthly payment So I go to the annual one and I'm going to confirm the billing cycle and at 
6:00 
I'm going to fill out these fields and then I'm going to give you the payment method So at 
6:05 I'm going 
to do it very quickly Done I've already configured my store and 
6:11 
now it's time to choose our domain, we already have it Of course it's going to be zip fix Pro dotcom, which we've previously reviewed 
6:17 
Godaddy was available, I'm going to the domains section of the store shopify and I'm going to 
6:24 
click on to buy a new domain you can enter 
6:34 
ok There it is available And I click to buy 
6:39 
Ok so this information is correct buy domain
6:46 
it doesn't automatically renew it because this store, as I'm going to be exposing it publicly, I'm going to have to close it because if they're not going to see 1000 stores 
6:52 
I have to verify the email so I'm going to do it very 
6 :58 
quick now what we are going to do next is to design a logo for our store notice that in the section 
Generation of the logo with brand AI 
7:04 
in the configuration we have to add it I am going to open a new tab and I am going to go at 
7:10 
brandmark.io is also an artificial intelligence tool that allows you to generate from words that you give it 
7:16
related to your logo, well, millions of logo options until you find one that you like, in this case I'm going to 
7:22 
enter I'm going to delete this if I'm going to introduce gadgets okay I'm going to enter zip and I'm going 
7:32 
to enter repeat ready I'm going to continue I'm going to choose the palette of blue colors 
7:38 
I think it will look better softer more subtle for something related 
7:44 
with clothing accessories is generating the logo 
7:50 
and it already gives me multiple options take a look here is the first one and then I can slide and there are infinities, that is, 
7:56 
I can slide, I go to this second one and now what I'm going to do is modify it, this doesn't go from 
8:02
this is not going to be DIY so I'm going to go to edit 
8:09 
and I'm going to go to icon s icon and look for another one we're going to enter 
8:17 
zip Search perfect and I'm going to this 
8:23 
second myself I think it's more than enough And now what I'm going to do is change the color palette I'm going to 
8:28 
some Blues I didn't like green too much and we also said that we were going to work on Blues The icon 
8:35 
I'm going to do it too turn blue and now I'm going to give the shabby a 
8:42 
screenshot Let's see There we are perfect 
8:47 
Now I'm going to go back to the store No here no sorry There we are and I'm going to 
8:52
add the logo upload image the screenshot same screen that I just did to open 
8:58 
so far everything is easy and artificial intelligence is helping us a lot along the way we haven't had to think much 
9:04 
just be good at copying and pasting well well there We have the logo and we're going to 
9:09 
the next step I'm going to the policies section and it's important to have the refund policy the policy 
Creating policies with AI 
9:15 
privacy to complement European regulations and many of you is something that You always ask me, hey 
9:21 
Bruno, where do I get the policies, well, chachinos solve it, I'm going to the chachipi, I'm going to open a new chat 
9:28
I can use 3.5, it doesn't matter, it generates a 
refund policy 
9:34 for a 
dropshipping store called 
9:39 
9:52 
The contact email that comes with the purchase of the domain is info@ 
10:00 
ipfixpro.com enter the 3.5 goes much faster look at you 
10:07 
it is already generating all the reimbursement policy yes it is true that here I do a little bit of 
10:14 
responsibility check it out But hey I to go fast and to understand the concept I go to 
10: 19 
copy this same policy I'm going to go back to shopify and I'm going to paste it ready and we'll paste it there okay And I'm going to generate the 
privacy policy the same now create the policy 
10:29 
10:35 
to deprive and it is already generating it for us, look super fast 
10:41 
I insist that things are sometimes a little 
10:47 
delicate that it would be good for you to review but generally I also tell you that these things have so much information 
10:53 
little girls websites with privacy policies that will undoubtedly do it wrong, that is to say, continue that one standing there 
11:00 
we can also press the button if you don't write it to them Okay until here and now 
11:05 
I'll go to copy and I'm going to paste the policy and I'm going to do the same with all the rest of the policies that there are. Let's go to 
product import 
11:12
The next step is going to be to import our product into applications. I'm going to introduce deserts this application from 
11:19 
here and I install it very well I'm in the dashboard I'm going to bad subscription and 
11:24 
here is an application that we have to select a subscription Although there is the free option, but notice that the other options are at 
11:30 
. The good thing is that you have the processing of group orders so that they are processed automatically 
at 11:36 
, which was something you knew about in its day. It was really super tedious because you had to go requested by 
11:42 
requested then in the plans that are paid You can use this In any case, I am going to use it to show you 
11:48
the free plan I'm going to import list here look and I'm going to click import and 
11:54 
now I'm going to copy the link of the product and I'm going to paste it here perfect 
12:00 
I find the product I select shopify post now I can leave this 
12 :06 
like this by default Olson Store for it to be published import is importing it to me 
12:13 
great imported now we can tell it to import the reviews 
12:19 
I click go to reviews and now I'll be seeing all the reviews good 
12: 26 
first I had to configure how many reviews I want to import and in what language I am going to put it to transcribe Spanish 
12:32
translate and take only the five-star ones and from all the countries I read before it matters and now I'm going to be 
12:38 
having to select which ones I want and which ones I don't 
12:48 
well, complete this task, I'm going to go back to products and see what I already have it imported click and we can see it in our store it is very simple this and what 
12:56 
yes the price because I have not configured it I have imported the aliexpress itself here are the reviews 
13:02 
well the title is as it is of the listing aliexpress please never leave the listing as it is and at 
13:08 
specifications change the description to work on it and for that chatti will help us we have to modify this 
13:14
from here and also change the price So I'm going to edit it and I'm going to put another price I'm going to put 14.95 is 
13:23 
what tells you about the perceived value is a product that can perfectly be sold for 1495 25 price comparison 
13:29 
so that they are on offer and we are going to give it free shipping I am going to refresh and notice that as there are 
13:36 
two variants I have only changed it in this one in the pack the one that comes with 14.95 25 offer 
13: 43 
and all this has to be changed I'm going to eliminate the other variant, I'm just going to keep the packaging one, which is the only one I'm interested in selling, now let's go Descriptions 
with AI 
13:49
to go to chachi vitti and we are going to generate the descriptions of the product as well as the title, something also that a lot of 
13:56 
people had a hard time copying it is something that I love but hey, he's not bad at all in fact he does it a lot 
14:03 
better on some occasions than people I've had Even hired at the agency that's how technology advances look at you 
14:10 
I put this Pro on it you are an expert copyright specialized in ecommerce generate a persuasive description of a product called civics Pro se It's about 
14:17 
a universal zipper kit that I explain what it is that can easily replace clothes or 
14:23
This is good if you use the information and characteristics indicated below to elaborate the description now 
what I am going to do is 
14:28 I am going to copy the info from the Express listing itself and 
14:33 
Hey let it work automatically chachipití 
14:39 
I'm going to the description and notice that I am going to copy the title as it is I am going to return and 
14:45 
I am going to paste it here okay And now I am going to go copy all the 
14:51 
specifications of the listing itself as it was dragged I copy it 
14:57 
and all the available information that the listing has, you can put it in chachi pity so that it processes it and at 
15:04 
work, I press enter And there it starts 
15:14
Wala, well, we would have it now, I'm going to copy the description if you want, you can stop the video and 
15:20 
read it I liked it How it turned out I'm going here I'm going to the specifications I delete all this 
15:28 
and paste the other one Perfect here we have it I'm going to copy the title 
15:34 
and I'm going to paste it right here 
15:40 
ok 
15:46 
I'm going to delete the rest I see it well ready because 
15:53 
​​we would have the description and title now what I'm going to do are some seconds of customization of the store does not have 
customization store and offer 
15:59  
too much mystery move some elements play with the colors give it a little more professional touch
16:05 
Here is the result look at you I have customized the store a little I have 
16:10
I added the description of some gifs that I found searching the internet about this product and there you have the 
16:16 
reviews I think it has been very clean I have taken it free and on the homepage I have put it 
16:23 
resurrect those clothes or accessories that remained invisible and there and Index to the product nothing a One product Store I have 
16:30 
also put the menu a section to locate your order that always gives confidence powered by Track 1.3 which is 
16:36 
an application I go back to the start and it redirects to the product that is everything leads me to the same product and now what I  
16:41
recommend is that since it is precisely an onep product store, a store that only has one product and the user who lands in our store will not be able to 
16:48 
buy more than one Well, at least we put a quantity ofer that is to say 
that 
16:53 we give the user a discount if they buy more units of this same product and it is also a type of product 
17:00 
which makes sense that they may want to buy more than one kit for this you can use the application if you search for 
17:07 
vandels with vanderer this Band Sorry you give it 
17:12 
add app there are many but this is one that I personally like and I'm going to 
17:17 
go to Install application it's there loading 
17:25 
give it a try. It has a 14- 
free 
18:22 
and now what I'm going to do is configure the offer Well before I have 
17:37
I have to activate the theme Sorry, activate the application, notice that I am here as the 
17:43 
widget activated, I come back, I recharge and it remains inserted in the store and now I go 
17:48 
to Add the offer, I am going to click on the Add offer button, select the product I will continue to the one I want 
17:53 
add and I will configure the quantin offer 
18:09 
well general generate offers and it shows me a preview and that's it Very good 
18:16 
well we would already have configured the bandle in our store later we will see it we will go ahead now 
Creating ads with AI 
to generate a script for our ad on social networks something that obviously 
18:28
We are also going to ask Artificial Intelligence for this I am going to insert it in the following Chrome If you had to make an ad 
18:36 
for social networks of this product with the aim of attracting the attention of potential buyers, what would it be like 
18 :47 
ok it's generating a possible ad copy not the script of the video I'm going to 
18:53 
have to be more specific we're going to wait for it to finish well I'm done I'm going to make it more specific 
18:59 
so you understand what it's about requesting pre for the script 
19:05 
for a video we need to publish 
19:13 
the plans that should be ready there 
19:26 
serve as an announcement
19:19 
19:58
goes video script now i got it shot 1 wide shot narrator are you 
19:31 
tired of struggling with broken and stuck zippers close-up shot of a person struggling with a broken zipper 
19:37 
narrator are you thinking of getting rid of your favorite clothes just for one damaged zipper shot 3 close-up at 
19:44 
the person dropping the garment in a laundry basket It's worth looking at He is specifying us in detail How we have to build our script exactly 
19:51 
to capture the attention of a possible user I am going to use or I'm going to try it in the time I have trying 
20:04
I'm going to let him finish preparing the script and 
now I'll start building 
20:10 
okay, he's done quite a few plans for me, maybe I should have also told him how long I wanted that ad to last 
20:16 
style that It lasts a maximum of 30 seconds for a product This is more than enough and it's going a bit beyond 
20:21 
So I'll take the plans that I think are most convenient and I'm going to start, as I said no at 
20:27 
to build, I'm going to start with the first plan for it what I will do is go to the internet and look for where I can get 
20:33 
These videos can be from Stock Galleries such as Story blocks We also have video elements or from YouTube itself 
20:42 
Check if we go to YouTube I have put Breaker here and we already have videos that I
These videos can be from Stock Galleries such as Story blocks We 
20:47 
They could be used to precisely follow that script that he has suggested 
. that doesn't strike you, not with the videos but that 
20:58 
you don't see, look at this plane for example, there we can show just the frustration of having a zipper stuck 
21:04 
okay, well, not anymore and with YouTube to mp4 I can easily download it 
21 :09 
any video you find on YouTube Although I recommend Stock Galleries 
21:15 
give you all the commercialization rights of these images there are many more videos anyway I'm going to 
21:21 
is I am going to look for several videos on the internet and I am going to try to compose that video 
21:26 
well I have already done the search for all of them the plans and now in a while I'm going to show you how it turned out But precisely 
21:32 
what we're going to do now is the voice-over the narration that charged us was 
21:37 
suggesting that we put those plans above and for that we are going to go to another artificial intelligence tool called voice over 
21:45 
dotcom I will also leave it in the description and notice that what I have done has been to insert it precisely 
21:50
copy and paste if it doesn't have too much mystery, that is, when you work with artificial intelligence You just have to  
21:55
be good with your fingers no control c control V well I copied what Chad told me to narrate about the 
22:02 
announcement and notice that here on the right you have a section with many with many voices I am going to put Spanish voices and 
22:09 
notice that we are scrolling we are going to look for the Spanish ones here they are 
22:15 
we have a man of a woman I have taken the one of Elías female voice lo I consider optimal for this product notice that 
22:21 
here I can write anything Ok and the voice you have chosen will narrate it to you I will give it Play just so that 
22:28
listen to it you are tired of fighting with broken or stuck zippers And you are thinking of getting rid of your favorite clothes 
listen to a detail if you don't think it's artificial intelligence it doesn't seem like it Now we are going to go to another tool called Sandra or dot ayou as you 
22:34
favorites very well the truth is that very natural I didn't stop at a wedding Artificial intelligence that's why so many 
22:40 
record companies are so afraid that famous songs are appearing Because there are also other 
22:46 
artificial intelligence tools that allow you to clone any voice simply by giving you previous audios of that same voice what 
22:54 
you can do with yours but the fact is that really if you don't stop at 
23:00 
23:06 
you will also imagine artificial intelligence that allows us to generate music music that does not exist and so 
23:11 
both totally free of copyright This is the web and 
23:18 
notice that it allows you to create unlimited music I am going to hit Play All this music is generated by 
artificial intelligence 
23:23 another 
23:29 
another by here I think you get the idea I'm going to go to the dashboard and I'm going to go to the 
23:35 
ads and trailers section that I want music to be generated for me, precisely for this I have uploaded the ad the plans from 
23:42 
video preview to be able to play the music and see how it looks with the ad, look at it now 
23:48
added the voice of struggling with broken or stuck zippers what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep trying music until I find one that I think fits well, the time has come to show you how the result  
23:56
of this advert has turned out 70% made with tools 
24:03 
Artificial intelligence the script purely with chachi pity the voice-over with another intelligence 
24:09 
artificial with shify the music with Sandra or period and the editing is the only thing 
24:14 
that I have done manually, so we could say 70% artificial intelligence and 30% human action there 
24:22 
we have Final Cut which is how I edit and we are going to hit Play you are tired of struggling with broken or stuck zippers 
24:28 
And you are thinking of getting rid of your favorite clothes this will fix any broken or stuck zippers for you 
24:35
adapts to all types of zippers people who travel consider it their salvation 
24:41 
Just remove the damaged one and easily put ours no need to sew or use 
24:48 
special tools slide it to fix it from boots 
24:53 
bags clothes in box in any Give New Life to your clothes and accessories 
24:59 
we ship for free throughout Spain Click on the button to get it And 
25:04 
take advantage of the 40% discount [Music]  
25:10
well I have done this last thing with canva this final as You see it is an advertisement with quite a dynamic rhythm that shows very 
25:17
well the product the solution that I tried and I think that it has been left with a sufficient rhythm in a way also 
25:24 
certainly as organic that does not seem like a very professional advertisement and it is the typical format that usually works very 
25:29 
well in the social networks especially on tiktok instagram Facebook Even at 
25:34 
YouTube could work very well I'll do a quick promotion on Facebook cats to see how everything turns out for us 
25:40 
what we've created with her there now let's see how it turned out the store that has taught us to look at it, 
25:52 
25:46
The band has been The offer Well, all the description we have already seen this but well it looks quite good The offer 
I think it can generate an increase in the ticket in the interesting cart let's see how I go to Facebook 
Configuring Facebook Ads 
25:57 
cats I am going to create a new campaign and I have created a new advertising account I am going to target sales I am going to give it to 
26:03 
continue the configuration you have not seen how I have done it for the account but we would make the video too long and 
26:09 
neither I want that campaign fic fix Pro Cold Aliens 
26:18 
I'm going to give it Advanced Valle 2018 I'm going to put 50 dollars a day for potholes that 
26:24
It's what this campaign is going to spend I'm going to hit next I'm going to configure the adset I'm going to select the Pixel that I've already  
26:31
configured I'm going to give it the purchase event ready it has the campaign there and now we're going 
26:37 
to do the segmentation of the audience to whom we are going to show our ad age, location, gender and interest 
26:43 
I am going to go to Chachi of course and I am going to ask them what segmentation 
26:50 
would you recommend to configure the advertising of this product 
properly 
27:02 on Facebook 
27:14 
we see again made divide is giving us demography interests behavior geography and local 
27:19 
audiences in the case of using it is strong
27:26  
and there we Give one last recommendation, okay Don't worry, you won't have at 
27:32
account so I'm going to base myself on what you have indicated I'm going to an age range of 25 to 55 years 27:39 
the 
interests that you have put here okay I'm going to go back let's go to age I'm going to 
27:46 
start Putting 25 I'm going to leave it at more than 65 no I'm not going to put it at 55 it's 
27:52 
the same because I think there are people over 65 who might be interested in this product who are there more focused on the place 
27:58 
interests I'm going to sew Well I'm going to start with the sewing one 
28:03 
okay I have it set in English but sewing okay Yes I know wink That's what 
28:09 
I have configured in English on Facebook I select this option Okay it gives me a range of 5 million to 6 
28: 16
I am going to also the behavior that said to segment users who have demonstrated online purchase behavior 
28:21 
in the past, that is to say, well, sorry, there have been end-of-life shoppers and 
28:33 
ready, select that option, there we have it and see how it has been reduced the target audience from 5 million 
28:40 
to a million and a half I am going to change the languages ​​I want it to only be shown to people who speak Spanish 
28:46 
no Spain no Spanish we are all there and 
28:51 
placement I will to leave automatically Yes, I think that everything is configured correctly We are going to click on continue and 
28:57
we are going to configure the creative itself the ads pro is the Facebook page with which I will be showing the 
29:37
29:04 
ad I'm going to create an ad and I'm going to load the multimedia content I'm going to give you that it's a video I'm going to Blood you 
29:11

29:23 
Not 100% it's ready here we see the different placements we could adapt it by size replace or 
29:30 
replace depending on the placement for Store and put a vertical format, even so, we can leave it and it will adapt and 
notice that there we can see a preview, you see, it will remain in Story, that is, it will not occupy 100% of the screen the rest 
29:43

30:26 
Well, we have to change the type of content, we have to put an image 
30:37

35:33 
will be more or less good let me show you what the results have been let me down This is working This is part of it here 
,  
35:39
I'm going to take it. There we are, okay Look at Facebook and I'm going to show you the

35:56 
budget dollars that I put in total about 5,000 people with a reach and 5,000-odd 
36:05 
impressions Let's go to the shopify store 5 orders have entered, one I don't know why at risk 
36:10 
soups sometimes Make me come down I know this is high risk, it would have to be canceled 
36:16 
reports and we have billed about 94.75 euros 
36:22 
Well there you see the metrics 149 sessions I'm going to go to applications I'm going to go to 
36:28 
deserts and wait while it loads 
36:34 
We are going to open orders we are going to calculate how much the 
36:47 
36:39
benefit tomorrow my products because I want to see the price of the product in the Express in a second but 
Let's see wait there ok we will go to the packaging plus the 
36:55 
shipment 0.78 since it takes about 15 days to add it to the basket only to have the 
37:00 
point of reference that I don't remember of 2.88 is worth with the shipment 2.88 
37:08 
And we have a kit one kit two kits two kits one kit 
37:14 
is worth this If not the calculations add 7 7 units sold I'm going to stock 
37:20 
calculator 7 
37:26 
times 2.88 is equal to worth 20.16 is the cost 
37:32 
of the product I'm going to delete this we have billed 
37:37 
94.75 perfect worth 94.75 less
37:44  
20.16 which is the cost of the product and now minus the cost of advertising that we have spent at this time 41, 98 
37:53
okay I'm going here 41 point 98 
37:59 
is equal to 32.61 dollars of profit well we have 
38:07 
there euros and dollars mixed but good More or less yes about 30 euros of 
38:12 
profit gives a little less this without counting taxes but what I'm going to do is 
38:18 
it's not bad at all, I mean, surprisingly while I was working 
38:23 
today I have been seeing that sales were coming in and because normally we are always very 
38:29 
used to it to make the decisions of what product we sell And at least the decision of the product never 
38:37
I had left until now that I decided to make this video experiment in the hands of artificial intelligence, yes it is 
38:42 
true that the last decision was made by me But at least the product that the idea 
38:47 
really gave me and there Well, I found a product with interesting packaging and that seemed to meet 
38:53 
my standards that I've always had when looking for a product and starting to validate it with dropshipping AND 
The real opportunity with AI 
39:00 
is that although it's true that today the AI ​​is not so powerful as to replace 100% of the work of the 
39:07
Humans have already seen it and it still requires a lot of human intervention Or at least what we have seen During 
39:13  
this video to be able to create an online business in about two to three years and I believe 
39:19
that if we keep moving so fast there could come a time when we simply give it a goal 
39:25 
style create a business and Commerce and 
39:31 artificial intelligence would do it directly for you 
in about two minutes because in the end it would be that there is also autopity but it would simply chain 
39:38 
processes and you really don't have to get excited it's not like This is going to be 
39:45 
brutal pressing a button you are going to have a business and Commerce guys that is 
39:50
It will become the worst time in history to start and do business when that happens the whole world will launch 
39:58 
40:38 
their online stores And then you will be trying to compete with hundreds for not 
40:04
say millions of businesses created with artificial intelligence that I insist will be competing with each other you will see At the end 
40:12 
everything in life always has a small window of opportunity this has always happened and now it is happening at 
40:19 
the digital age therefore you must be very aware that there is this small 
40:24 
window of opportunity in time about two to three years where artificial intelligence is still not powerful enough to 
40:30 
create 10 million direct competitors against your business and it is something that you have to take advantage of and the 
reality is that within this window that we now have there are many opportunities, think about 
40:44 
number of businesses that still have no idea how to use chachipití, for example, among many other 
40:51 
tools that are out there that are brutal and that could help them increase their productivity and their profits 
40:57 
So if you are really interested in taking advantage of all this technology and this train I have created 
41:03 
a training course on the opportunities that exist with artificial intelligence and how we are using it in 
41:09 
the agency today to get the most out of it squeeze all its bucket you will find this formation within 
41:15
mentorial an educational platform that seeks to offer new training every month to its members for a very  
41:21
low fee per month less in fact than what the gym costs you have to train the muscles but also the mind 
41:27 
and for me mentorial is the 41:34 gym than your portfolio, and not only will I be there, but incredible formations are coming 
41:34 
from the hand of people who are really having very good results since that is the 
41:39 
filter that puts Yes or yes mentorial so that you can be an instructor in there and that is that you have proven results and 
41:47 
demonstrated results with whatever it is that you teach. So I'm going to leave you a link right in the description of this video 
41:52
so you can take a look at it without any kind of commitment and if you're interested in entering, well, we'll meet inside the 
41:58 
Artificial Intelligence training where I really promise you that I'll make your head explode if this video freaks you out, that training will It's going to 
42:06 
hallucinate So just a little more, whatever it is, we'll see each other in training or in the next video I'll see you soon
