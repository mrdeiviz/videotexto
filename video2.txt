in the last few months I decided to
0:02
focus more on selling digital products
0:04
and I've reached a point now where I'm
0:06
making consistent income every month
0:08
just by selling digital products online
0:10
so in today's video I'll reveal the
0:12
product that has made me over ten
0:14
thousand dollars and show you the steps
0:16
you need to take in order to start your
0:18
own digital product business I'll also
0:20
answer some of the questions you've
0:21
asked on my Discord server by the end of
0:24
the video so make sure to keep watching
0:25
before we begin I'd like to point out
0:27
that we only use tick tock and YouTube
0:29
shorts to drive traffic which means all
0:32
results were achieved without spending a
0:34
single penny on paid ads and it all
0:35
started in February of this year as we
0:38
earned a total of one thousand five
0:39
hundred dollars that month and twelve
0:41
hundred dollars in March which was a
0:43
great start but in April things went
0:45
more crazy as one of the tick tock
0:47
videos went viral as you can see this
0:49
big spike right here is where the video
0:52
got lots of attention which was
0:53
definitely our best month with a total
0:55
of five thousand dollars the month after
0:57
we made two thousand dollars and this
0:59
month so far by the time I'm recording
1:01
we're at eight hundred dollars so from
1:04
the beginning of the year until now
1:05
we've made well over ten thousand
1:07
dollars so what's the product what's the
1:09
business model and how can you start a
1:11
similar business all of that and more
1:12
will be covered in today's video
Types of Digital Products
1:14
so when it comes to digital products
1:16
there are two types done with you and
1:19
done for you assume you're a personal
1:21
trainer offering a training program that
1:23
includes weekly live calls to answer
1:25
questions this business model is known
1:28
as done with you or let's say you're
1:31
also a personal trainer but you want to
1:33
sell an ebook that includes tips to
1:34
speed up fat loss this model will be
1:37
done for you as you'll be giving the
1:39
solution right away but no matter what
1:41
you choose you must have a clear idea
1:43
about your target audience or in other
Niche Selection
1:45
words your Niche now I've talked a lot
1:47
about Niche selection but to make it
1:49
simple the best digital products are in
1:51
a health wealth or relationship niches
1:53
these are evergreen niches meaning
1:55
there's always demand for them and I
1:58
always recommend choosing something you
2:00
enjoy doing or have experience with
2:02
because this will make the process much
2:04
easier down the line so in my case I
2:07
really like the making money online
2:08
Niche and after choosing the niche you
2:11
need to narrow it down to something more
2:13
specific the best best way to do that is
2:15
by writing down terms related to your
2:18
Niche this could be Drop Shipping
2:20
Etsy print on demand and so on so I
2:23
decided to go with Drop Shipping which
2:25
is something I did and have good
2:26
experience with and remember that the
2:28
best way to make money is by solving
2:30
problems so if you know the pain points
2:32
of your target audience it'll be so easy
2:34
for you to come up with a winning
2:35
product idea and because I did Drop
2:37
Shipping myself I know that getting a
2:40
store running is one of the hardest
2:42
things to do as a beginner and that
2:44
includes finding the right product
2:45
creating video ads writing product
2:47
descriptions and so on and this is where
2:49
I came up with the Drop Shipping success
2:52
kit the product includes pretty much
2:54
everything needed to start Drop Shipping
2:55
as a beginner winning products video ads
2:58
product descriptions ad copies and a lot
3:00
more and if you do Drop Shipping or at
3:03
least heard of it you must know how this
3:05
solution can save a lot of time and
3:06
money we honestly spend a lot of time
3:09
and money creating this product and we
3:11
also do consistent updates to ensure we
3:13
provide as much value you as possible
3:15
but let's say you're someone who doesn't
3:17
have the time or experience to come up
3:19
with product ideas and build everything
3:21
from scratch well there's a solution
3:23
called plr content which stands for
3:26
private label rights that means instead
Private Label Rights
3:29
of building your own digital products
3:31
you can purchase the rights of already
3:33
existing products Rebrand them and then
3:36
sell as your own and there's a
3:38
well-known website called plr dot me
3:41
that specializes in this stuff on the
3:44
website you can find all types of
3:46
digital products done for you and ready
3:48
to use you'll find pretty much
3:50
everything from ebooks courses
3:52
worksheets and more so you can hover
3:54
over products at the top to see the
3:56
different categories or you can use the
3:59
search bar to look for a specific
4:00
product in mind let's say you want to
4:03
sell something in the weight loss Niche
4:04
simply type weight loss and click search
4:07
now you can look through the different
4:09
products and see the different options
4:10
to choose from you also have some
4:13
filters on the left side to help narrow
4:15
down the results once you choose
4:16
something you like scroll down to get
4:18
more information about the product and
4:20
on the left you'll see what you can do
4:22
after purchase so here it says that we
4:24
can Rebrand it sell it and keep one
4:26
hundred percent of the profit so if I
4:28
decided to buy this ebook for example
4:30
what I'll do is completely change the
4:33
design layout to make it look more
4:34
professional so the content will stay
4:36
the same and I'll just change the design
4:38
to fit my brand and you can find lots of
4:40
pre-built templates on canva for example
4:42
and I personally like to use plr content
4:46
to capture leads so you can give away an
4:49
ebook for free in exchange for an email
4:51
address that way you can build an email
4:53
list to sell other products in the same
4:56
Niche another cool way to find digital
4:58
products to resell is by simply using
5:00
Google so let's say you want to sell an
5:03
online course about weight loss you
5:05
basically type white label courses and
5:08
then your Niche which is in our case
5:10
weight loss as you can see you'll get
5:12
lots of options to choose from for
5:15
example I've found this training program
5:17
that includes pre-recorded videos guides
5:20
marketing materials and other stuff that
5:22
we can buy and sell as our own
5:25
now you might be wondering why I prefer
5:28
digital products to physical products
Why Digital Products
5:30
well there are many reasons but here are
5:32
my top three first your profit margin is
5:35
much higher because you don't have any
5:37
product costs this means you may build a
5:40
digital product once and sell it forever
5:42
second you won't have to worry about
5:44
shipping delays or anything else because
5:46
most digital products will be delivered
5:48
immediately after purchase leading to
5:51
more satisfied customers and finally
5:53
digital products are more easier to grow
5:56
since they can be sold worldwide unlike
5:58
physical products where sometimes it's
6:01
hard to ship everywhere now I want you
6:03
to tell me in the comment section if you
6:05
want me to start a new series in which
6:08
we build a digital product business and
6:10
try to make sales together I think that
6:12
will be good since I can show you my
6:14
process from start to finish and
6:16
hopefully we can build something
6:17
successful and now as promised let me
6:20
answer some of your questions starting
Questions Answers
6:22
with the first one on average how much
6:25
time does it take to make a video from
6:26
start to finish well it depends on the
6:29
video of course but on average we spend
6:31
one day brainstorming ideas two days
6:33
writing the script and another two days
6:35
on editing so that'll be five days in
6:38
total I've made a video recently talking
6:39
about YouTube so if you're interested
6:41
feel free to check it out the second
6:43
question we have is how to stand out on
6:45
Etsy and get more sales well that mainly
6:48
depends on your product first as you
6:50
must ensure that your product is in
6:51
demand but what you can do is either
6:53
provide more value than your competitors
6:55
or make your product look better by
6:58
choosing different colors for example
6:59
I've also made multiple videos about
7:02
Etsy that you can check out as well what
7:04
was your first ever business I actually
7:07
started making money online as a video
7:09
editor back in 2019 so I was working on
7:12
freelancing websites like Fiverr and
7:14
upwork then I specialized in creating
7:16
Drop Shipping video ads on Fiverr the
7:18
best way to make money without spending
7:20
any Penny I think the best way to make
7:22
money without spending a single penny is
7:24
by finding a job
7:27
